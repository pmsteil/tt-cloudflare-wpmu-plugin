Keeps your CloudFlare DNS updated, creating records for all your new subdomains.

== Description ==

<p>Every time a new blog is created, a CNAME record will be added via the CloudFlare API.<br>

This allows you to accelerate and protect individual CNAMEs since CloudFlare <a href="http://support.cloudflare.com/kb/adding-sites-cloudflare/does-cloudflare-support&lt;br /&gt;
wildcard-dns-entries"> does not proxy wildcard entries.</a></p>

<p>If you need to sync your existing blogs, please upgrade to our <a href="http://stiofan.themetailors.com/store/products/tt-cloudflare-wpmu-plugin-pro/">PRO version</a>.<br>

3. Email Address: (the email address you use to login to www.cloudflare.com)
4. Your API Key: (you can find your CloudFlare API key here https://www.cloudflare.com/myaccount)
5. Zone URL: (this is simply the domain of your main site with no prefix e.g.: example.com)
6. Automatically add new blogs: (If yes this will add the required settings to CloudFlare automatically when a new blog is created)
7. This plugin will not be able to sync all pre-existing sites, please upgrade to PRO if you wish to do so.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does it work with mapped domain? =

With mapped domains every new domain must be manually created on CloudFlare, as there is no way to do that through API at the moment.

We have asked if adding this feature was something they would consider, and they said : "It's under discussion, but not immediate."

If it will happen, we'll definetly work on it... 

= Does it sync existing blogs? =

No it doesn't, you need the PRO version for that. <a href="http://stiofan.themetailors.com/store/products/tt-cloudflare-wpmu-plugin-pro/">CloudFlare WPMU Plugin â€“ PRO</a>
